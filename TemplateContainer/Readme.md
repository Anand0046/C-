Templates are a feature of the C++ programming language that allows functions and classes to operate with generic types. This allows a function or class to work on many different data types without being rewritten for each one.
Overview:
   1. The code in the repo is a linked list based template class.
   2. The list is made generic using template class to store any type of data for ex:- int values, float values, structure object, class o       object.
 Working:
    1. Download entire template container folder or download Conainer.h and main.cpp file.
    2. Add the above files to your project and execute the main file.
